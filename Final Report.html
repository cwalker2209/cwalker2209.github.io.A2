<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide headings for sections of a Web page, when the page is organized into sections. For instance, long documents are often divided into a variety of chapters, chapters have subtopics and subtopics are divided into various sections, sections into paragraphs, etc. When such sections exist, they need to have headings that introduce them. This clearly indicates the organization of the content, facilitates navigation within the content, and provides mental "handles" that aid in comprehension of the content. Other page elements may complement headings to improve presentation (e.g., horizontal rules and boxes), but visual presentation is not sufficient to identify document sections.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconFail.png" height="15" alt="Failed"><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G141">G141</a> Organize a page using headings

Such services use a trained human operator who listens in to what is being said and uses a special keyboard to enter the text with only a small delay. They are able to capture a live event with a high degree of fidelity, and also to insert notes on any non spoken audio which is essential to understanding the event.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text that is presented over a background. For Success Criterion 1.4.3, this technique describes the minimum contrast ratio for text that is less than 18 point (if not bold) and less than 14 point (if bold). For Success Criterion 1.4.5, this technique relaxes the 7:1 contrast ratio requirement for text that is at least 18 point (if not bold) or at least 14 point (if bold).

If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the relative luminance of the text can be maintained by making sure that each of the text letters have 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background. 

If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned) then the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the letters maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background behind them even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background. 

The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes across the page. 

Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.

<div class="tooltip">Users with vision loss or cognitive challenges often require specific foreground (text) and background color combinations. For instance, many people with                        low vision find it much easier to see a Web page that has white text on a                        black background, so they may have set their user agent to create this                        contrast. If the author specifies that the text must be black, then it may                        override the settings of the user agent and render a page that has black                        text (specified by the author) on black background (that was set in the user                        agent). This principle also works in reverse. If the Webmaster forces the                        background to be white, then the white background specified by the author                        would be the same color as the white text (which was set in the user agent)                        rendering the page unusable to the user. Therefore, if the author specifies                        a foreground (text) color then they should also specify a background color                        which has sufficient contrast (link) with the foreground and vice versa.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconPass.png" height="15" alt="Passed">Page contain no elements that specific foreground color but no background color or vice versa

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">This failure describes a common condition where links such as "click here" or "more" are used as anchor elements where you need to have the surrounding text to understand their purpose and where there isn't any mechanism to make the destination clear by itself, such as a button to expand the link text.

Many blind people who use screen readers call up a dialog box that has a list of links from the page. They use this list of links to decide where they will go. But if many of the links in that list simply say "click here" or "more" they will be unable to use this feature in their screen reader, which is a core navigation strategy. That's why it's a failure of 2.4.9 to not provide any way of allowing them to know the destination from the link text alone. It is also true for people who tab through links. If all they hear as they tab through the document is "click here, click here, click here etc." they will become confused.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A">No Anchor elements found on the page.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">Users with vision loss or cognitive challenges often require specific foreground (text) and background color combinations. For instance, many people with                        low vision find it much easier to see a Web page that has white text on a                        black background, so they may have set their user agent to create this                        contrast. If the author specifies that the text must be black, then it may                        override the settings of the user agent and render a page that has black                        text (specified by the author) on black background (that was set in the user                        agent). This principle also works in reverse. If the Webmaster forces the                        background to be white, then the white background specified by the author                        would be the same color as the white text (which was set in the user agent)                        rendering the page unusable to the user. Therefore, if the author specifies                        a foreground (text) color then they should also specify a background color                        which has sufficient contrast (link) with the foreground and vice versa.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconPass.png" height="15" alt="Passed">Page contain no elements that specific foreground color but no background color or vice versa

People who communicate extensively in sign language are also faster in sign language and synchronized media is a time-based presentation.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A"><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G54">G54</a> Include a sign language interpreter in the video stream

<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how CSS can be used to replace structured HTML text with images of text in a way that makes it possible for users to view content according to their preferences. To use this technique, an author starts by creating an HTML page that uses semantic elements to mark up the structure of the page. The author then designs two or more stylesheets for that page. One stylesheet presents the HTML text as text and the second uses CSS features to replace some of the HTML text with images of text. Finally, through the use of server-side or client-side ing, the author provides a control that allows the user to switch between the available views. </div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A">Page does not use CSS background images

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to help people who are blind, people who have low vision, and people with reading disabilities to understand content in cases where meaning depends on pronunciation. Often words or characters have different meanings, each with its own pronunciation. The meaning of such words or characters can usually be determined from the context of the sentence. However, for more complex or ambiguous sentences, or for some languages, the meaning of the word cannot be easily determined or determined at all without knowing the pronunciation. When the sentence is read aloud and the screen reader reads the word using the wrong pronunciation, it can be even more difficult to understand than when read visually. When words are ambiguous or indeterminate unless the pronunciation is known, then providing some means of determining the pronunciation is needed.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A"><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G62">G62</a> Provide a glossary

<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to make the definition of a word, phrase, or abbreviation available by providing the definition in a glossary. A glossary is an alphabetical list of words, phrases, and abbreviations with their definitions. Glossaries are most appropriate when the words, phrases, and abbreviations used within the content relate to a specific discipline or technology area. A glossary can also provide the pronunciation of a word or phrase.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A">Page does not contain significant content.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by non-text content accessible through the use of a text alternative.  Text alternatives are a primary way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. A person who cannot hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check"><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G144.html">G144</a> Ensuring that the Web Page contains another CAPTCHA serving the same purpose ...

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to group items in a selection list. A selection list is a set of allowed values for a form control such as a multi-select list or a combo box. Often, selection lists have groups of related options. Those groups should be semantically identified, rather than simply delimiting the groups with "dummy" list entries. This allows user agents to collapse the options by group to support quicker skimming of the options, and to indicate in what group an option of interest is located. It also helps to visually break up long lists so that users can more easily locate the option(s) they are interested in.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check">Examine set of options to determine if they should be arranged into logical groups.

For instance, a user agent may display the page title in the  window title bar or as the name of the tab containing the page.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check"><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H25.html">H25</a> Pages are required to use the TITLE element

When an image is the only content of a link, the text alternative for the image describes the unique function of the link.

When the content of a link contains both text and one or more images, if the text is sufficient to describe the purpose of the link, the images may have an empty text alternative. (See Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that assistive technology should ignore.) When the images convey information beyond the purpose of the link, they must also have appropriate alt text.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check">Confirm ALT or TITLE attribute text describes the purpose of the link.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to watch synchronized media presentations.

<div class="tooltip">When content includes multiple formats, one or more user agents or plug-ins                        are often needed in order to successfully present the content to users.

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to make sure that users can read text that is presented over a background. For Success Criterion 1.4.3, this technique describes the minimum contrast ratio for text that is less than 18 point (if not bold) and less than 14 point (if bold). For Success Criterion 1.4.5, this technique relaxes the 7:1 contrast ratio requirement for text that is at least 18 point (if not bold) or at least 14 point (if bold).

If the background is a solid color (or all black or all white) then the relative luminance of the text can be maintained by making sure that each of the text letters have 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background. 

If the background or the letters vary in relative luminance (or are patterned) then the background around the letters can be chosen or shaded so that the letters maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background behind them even if they do not have that contrast ratio with the entire background. 

The contrast ratio can sometimes be maintained by changing the relative luminance of the letters as the relative luminance of the background changes across the page. 

Another method is to provide a halo around the text that provides the necessary contrast ratio if the background image or color would not normally be sufficiently different in relative luminance.

<div class="tooltip">Users with vision loss or cognitive challenges often require specific foreground (text) and background color combinations. For instance, many people with                        low vision find it much easier to see a Web page that has white text on a                        black background, so they may have set their user agent to create this                        contrast. If the author specifies that the text must be black, then it may                        override the settings of the user agent and render a page that has black                        text (specified by the author) on black background (that was set in the user                        agent). This principle also works in reverse. If the Webmaster forces the                        background to be white, then the white background specified by the author                        would be the same color as the white text (which was set in the user agent)                        rendering the page unusable to the user.

<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how CSS can be used to replace structured HTML text with images of text in a way that makes it possible for users to view content according to their preferences. To use this technique, an author starts by creating an HTML page that uses semantic elements to mark up the structure of the page. The author then designs two or more stylesheets for that page. One stylesheet presents the HTML text as text and the second uses CSS features to replace some of the HTML text with images of text. Finally, through the use of server-side or client-side ing, the author provides a control that allows the user to switch between the available views. </div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A">Page does not use CSS background images

<ul>
<div class="tooltip">The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid serious consequences as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be reversed. For example, purchasing non-refundable airline tickets or submitting an order to purchase stock in a brokerage account are financial transactions with serious consequences. If a user has made a mistake on the date of air travel, he or she could end up with a ticket for the wrong day that cannot be exchanged. If the user made a mistake on the number of stock shares to be purchased, he or she could end up purchasing more stock than intended. Both of these types of mistakes involve transactions that take place immediately and cannot be altered afterwards, and can be very costly. Likewise, it may be an unrecoverable error if users unintentionally modify or delete data stored in a database that they later need to access, such as their travel profile in a travel services Web site. Test data is included in this provision because, in order for tests to be valid, users are not allowed to modify their answers once submitted; so users need to be able to ensure that their submission is correct.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check"><a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G98">G98</a> Provide the ability for the user to review and correct answers before submitting

<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to provide users with a way to ensure their input is correct before completing an irreversible transaction. Testing, financial, and legal applications permit transactions to occur which cannot be "undone". It is therefore important that there be no errors in the data submission, as the user will not have the opportunity to correct the error once the transaction has been committed.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconVisual.png" height="15" alt="Visual check">Verify that user has ability to review and correct answers before submitting

<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to all additional audio deion to be
                        inserted into a synchronized media presentation when there is not enough time in the
                        gaps int the dialog. This is done by simply freezing the image so that
                        additional audio deion of the video can be played. When the
                        deion is finished, the synchronized media continues.</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A">Page does not contain video

<div class="tooltip">The objective of this technique is to describe how the <code>link</code> element can            provide metadata about the position of an HTML page within a set of Web pages or can            assist in locating content with a set of Web pages. The value of the <code>rel</code>            attributes indicates what type of relation is being described, and the <code>href</code>            attribute provides a link to the document having that relation. Multiple            <code>link</code> elements can provide multiple relationships. Several values of              <code>rel</code> are useful:</div><li>	<img src="./https___cwalker2209.github.io_index.html - WCAG 2.0 AAA_files/iconNA.png" height="15" alt="N/A">Link is not used for document navigation
